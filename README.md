A Flood basically is an overflow of water that submerges land that is usually dry. Flooding may occur as an overflow of water from water bodies, such as a river, lake, or ocean, in which the water overtops or breaks levees, resulting in some of that water escaping its usual boundaries. It can be caused by natural precipitation, elevation of flowing water in water bodies and melting of heavy snow caps.

Along with drought, floods is the most fatal natural calamity in this world. It causes loss of life and damage to buildings and other structures. Economic hardship due to a temporary decline in tourism, rebuilding costs, or food shortages leading to price increases is a common after-effect of severe flooding. It has been estimated that yearly in the United States, floods cause over $7.5 billion in damage. 

We, Tech Tycoons have developed a solution to tackle this problem. We created a model that helps us to classify the water level on roads, which can be used to alert the government in advance about the floods.
